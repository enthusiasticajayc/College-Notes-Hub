📚 College Notes Hub
A Smart Digital Platform to Upload, Organize & Share Academic Notes

College Notes Hub is a modern, responsive web application that allows students to upload, preview, search, filter, and download subject notes department-wise and semester-wise.

Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates dynamic UI handling, file management using the FileReader API, and browser-based data persistence using LocalStorage.
